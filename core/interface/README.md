Interface Modules
-----------------
Rax front-end interface modules reside here.

The Rax front-end is made up of two components: one for technical roles (developers/system administrators/webmasters/themes), and another for editorial (content creators, authors, editors, etc). When going to the Rax front-end interface ('/rax') depending on your user roles/permissions, you will have one or both panels available.
